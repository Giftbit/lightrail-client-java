# Lightrail Client Library

Lightrail is a modern platform for digital account credits, gift cards, promotions, and points â€”to learn more, visit [Lightrail](https://www.lightrail.com/). The goal of this client library is to facilitate integrating with the Lightrail API in Java. If you are looking for specific use-cases or other languages, check out the *Integrations* section of the [Lightrail API documentation](https://www.lightrail.com/docs/).

## Features ##

The following features are supported in this version:

- Account Credits: create, retrieve, balance-check, and create/simulate transactions.
- Gift Cards: create, retrieve, balance-check, and create/simulate transactions.

Note that the Lightrail API supports many other features and we are still working on covering them in this library. For a complete list of Lightrail API features check out the [Lightrail API documentation](https://www.lightrail.com/docs/). 

## Usage ##

Before making any calls, set up your Lightrail API key. 

```java
Lightrail.apiKey = "<your lightrail API key>";
```

### Account Credits

The `LightrailContact` class provides the functionality to support account credit use-cases. For further discussion of Account Cards check out the [Lightrail API documentation](https://www.lightrail.com/docs/). 

#### Creating Contacts

To create a new customer account, call `LightrailContact.create()`:

```java
String email = "test@test.ca";
String firstName = "Test";
String lastName = "McTest";
LightrailContact contact = LightrailContact.create(email, firstName, lastName);
```

#### Retrieving Customer Accounts

Using the `contactId`, you can later retrieve the Contact. This will fetch the Contact object and all of its associated Account Cards.

```java
String contactId = contact.getContactId();
//later
LightrailContact contact = LightrailContact.retrieve(contactId);
```

After creating a contact, you need to define the currencies it should support. Each currency will be tracked and stored separately by a different Account Card. For example, you can specify that a Contact will have USD and CAD accounts, each with a $5 initial balance:

```java
//...
LightrailContact contact = LightrailContact.create(email, firstName, lastName);
contact.addCurrency("USD", 500)
       .addCurrency("CAD", 500);
```

#### Maximum Value and Balance-Checking

The `retrieveMaximumValue()` methods of a `LightrailContact` object return the maximum value of the account in a given currency. Note that when using conditional promotions, some portions of this value might only be available under certain conditions.

```java
int maximumValue = contact.retrieveMaximumValue("USD");
```

To get the precise value a Contact can contribute to a specific Transaction, use one of the `byContact` or `byShopperId` methods in `Transaction.Simulate`. 

```java
String contactId = contact.getContactId();
int txValue = -20455;
String currency = "USD";
Metadata metadata = new Metadata();
//fill in the metadata
LightrailTransaction simulatedTx = 
  LightrailTransaction.Simulate.byContact(contactId, txValue, currency, metadata);
//or
String shopperId = contact.getShopperId();
LightrailTransaction simulatedTx = 
  LightrailTransaction.Simulate.byShopperId(shopperId, txValue, currency, metadata);
int availableValue = 0 - simulatedTx.getValue();
```

#### Transactions

To transact against a Contact, call one of the `createTransaction` methods in `LightrailContact`. 

```java
LightrailTransaction tx = contact.createTransaction(-200, "USD");
```

Alternatively, you can use one of the `byContact` or `byShopperId` methods in `LightrailTransaction.Create`. The former needs the `contactId` and the latter needs the `userSuppliedId` of the Contact in question, also known as `shopperId`.

```java
String shopperId = contact.getShopperId();
Metadata metadata = new Metadata();
//fill in the metadata
LightrailTransaction tx = LightrailTransaction.Create.byShopperId(shopperId, -200, "USD", metadata);
```

#### Authorize-Capture

To create a pending Transaction, use one of the `pendingByContact` or `pendingByShopperId` methods in `LightrailTransaction.Create`. You need to call `capture()` or `doVoid()` on the resulting `LightrailTransaction` object later.

```java
LightrailTransaction tx = LightrailTransaction.Create.pendingByContact("<contactId>", -100, "USD");
//later        
tx.capture();
//or        
tx.doVoid();
```

Note that `capture()` and `doVoid()` return a new `LightrailTransaction` object.  

#### Refunding

To undo a drawdown Transaction, call one of the the `refund()` methods on the Transaction object. You can retrieve the Transaction object using a suitable `retrieve` method from `LightrailTransaction`. Note that `refund()` returns a new `LightrailTransaction` object.  

```java
String cardId = contact.getCardFor("USD").getCardId();
String txId = "...";
LightrailTransaction tx = LightrailTransaction.Retrieve.byCardIdAndTransactionId(cardId, txId);
//later:
LightrailTransaction refundTx = tx.refund();
```

#### Freezing and Unfreezing Accounts

Freezing an account suspends its value until it is unfrozen. This is a suitable method for investigating potential fraud. To freeze or unfreeze an Account, get the corresponding Account Card and call its `freeze()` or `unfreeze()` method.

```java
AccountCard accCard = contact.getCardFor("USD");
accCard.freeze();
//later:
accCard.unfreeze();
```

Note that freezing and unfreezing a card are special transactions and the corresponding `LightrailTransaction` object will be returned by these methods.

#### Single-Currency Accounts

For simpler cases where only one currency is defined for the Contact, you can use a simpler interface without having to specify the currency for each and every call. For example, if you have a points program (for which the standard currency code is `XXX` ) you can use these simpler methods as the following:

```java
String email = "test@test.ca";
String firstName = "Test";
String lastName = "McTest";
String currency = "XXX";
int initialBalance = 500;

LightrailContact contact = LightrailContact.create(email,
                                                   firstName, 
                                                   lastName, 
                                                   currency, 
                                                   initialBalance);
//later 
LightrailTransaction tx = contact.createPendingTransaction(-300);
//later 
tx.capture();
//or        
tx.doVoid();
```

Note that if the Contact has more than one currency, these calls will throw a `BadParameterException`.

### Gift Cards

A Lightrail Gift Card is a virtual device for issuing gift values. Each Gift Card has a specific `currency`, a `cardId`, as well as a `fullCode`, which is a unique unguessable alphanumeric string, usually released to the gift recipient in confidence. The recipient of the Gift Card can present the `fullCode` to redeem the gift value. For further discussion of Gift Cards check out the [Lightrail API documentation](https://www.lightrail.com/docs/).

#### Creating Gift Cards

Gift Cards are created as part of a Gift Card Program. You can set up a Gift Card Program using the Lightrail [Web App](https://www.lightrail.com). Once you have a Gift Card Program, you need to provide its `programId` for creating Gift Cards in that program. To create a Gift Card, call one of the `create()` methods in the `GiftCard` class. For example:

```java
String programId = "...";
int initialValue = 400;
GiftCard newGiftCard = GiftCard.create(programId, initialValue);
//or
String startDate = "2017-08-02T00:27:02.910Z";
String expiryDate = "2017-10-02T00:27:02.910Z";
Metadata metadata = new Metadata();
        metadata.put("orderId", "x72a3sx5e");
        metadata.put("recipientEmail", "recipient@test.ca");
        metadata.put("purchaserName", "Alice Liddell");
        metadata.put("purchaserEmail", "alice@wonderland.ca");
GiftCard newGiftCard = GiftCard.create(programId, 
                                       initialValue, 
                                       startDate, 
                                       expiryDate, 
                                       metadata);
```

To pass more parameters such as `userSuppliedId`, you can use the generic `create()` method which accepts a `RequestParameters` object, a subtype of `Map<String,Object>`).

#### Retrieving the Gift Code

To retrieve the `fullCode` of a Gift Card, call the `retrieveFullCode()` method on a `GiftCard` object. Usually, you make this call after creating the Gift Card to email the Gift Code to the gift recipient. We advise that you refrain from persisting the `fullcode` in your system and retrieve it from the API whenever you need it.

```java
String programId = "...";
int initialValue = 400;
GiftCard newGiftCard = GiftCard.create(programId, initialValue);
String fullCode = newGiftCard.retrieveFullCode();
//email the fullCode to the recipient of the gift.
```

#### Retrieving Gift Cards

To retrieve an existing Gift Card, use one of the `retrieve()` methods. 

```java
GiftCard existingGiftCard = GiftCard.retrieveByCardId("<cardId>");
//
GiftCard existingGiftCard = GiftCard.retrieveByUserSuppliedId("<userSuppliedId>");
```

#### Card Details

To get details of the available value and promotions on a Gift Card, call the `retrieveCardDetails()`method. The principal value of the Card as well as its attached promotions are returned in the `CardDetails` object.

```java
CardDetails cardDetails = giftCard.retrieveCardDetails();
for (ValueStore valueStore : cardDetails.getValueStores()) {
   if("ACTIVE".equals(valueStore.getState()))
      //print valueStore details. 
}
```

To get the details of a Gift Card based on its `fullcode`, use the following static method in the `GiftCard` class.

```java
String fullcode = "...";
CardDetails cardDetails = GiftCard.retrieveCardDetailsByCode(fullcode);
```

#### Maximum Value and Balance-Checking ####

To get the maximum possible value of a Gift Card, use the `retrieveMaximumValue()` method. Note that not all of this value is available for every transaction as there might be some conditional Promotions attached to the Card which are only unlocked under certain conditions. 

```java
int maximumValue = giftCard.retrieveMaximumValue();
```

To get the exact value of a Gift Card in the context of a transaction you can use one of the `simulate` methods in the `Transaction` class and check the `value` of the returned simulated transaction. Note that this value shows the maximum drawdown transaction value that will go through for this Card in that context, so it is negative.

```java
String fullcode = "...";
int orderValue = -20455;
String currency = "USD";
Metadata metadata = new Metadata();
//fill in the metadata
LightrailTransaction simulatedTx = 
  LightrailTransaction.Simulate.byCode(fullcode, orderValue, currency, metadata);
int availableValue = 0 - simulatedTx.getValue();
```

#### Transactions

To create a Transaction on a Gift Card use a suitable methods in `LightrailTransaction.Create`. For example:

```java
String fullcode = "...";
int orderValue = -20455;
String currency = "USD";
Metadata metadata = new Metadata();
//fill in the metadata
LightrailTransaction tx = 
  LightrailTransaction.Create.byCode(fullcode, orderValue, currency, metadata);
```

Note that Lightrail does not support currency exchange and the currency provided to these methods must match the currency of the Card.

#### Authorize-Capture

To create a `pending` Transaction, use one of the methods in `LightrailTransaction.Create` with `pending` in its name. You should later call one of the available `capture()` or `doVoid()` methods on the returned pending Transaction object to either collect the pending Transaction or cancel it:

```java
String fullcode = "...";
int orderValue = -20455;
String currency = "USD";
Metadata metadata = new Metadata();
//fill in the metadata
LightrailTransaction pendingTx = 
  LightrailTransaction.Create.pendingByCode(fullcode, orderValue, currency, metadata);
//later:
LightrailTransaction capturedTx = pendingTx.capture();
//or
LightrailTransaction voidedTx = pendingTx.cancel();
```

Note that `capture()` and `doVoid()` return a new `LightrailTransaction` object.  

#### Refunding

To undo a drawdown Transaction, call one of the the `refund()` methods on the Transaction object. Note that `refund()` returns a new `LightrailTransaction` object.  

```java
String cardId = "...";
String transactionId = "...";
LightrailTransaction tx = 
  LightrailTransaction.Retrieve.byCardIdAndTransactionId(cardId, transactionId);
//later:
LightrailTransaction refundTx = tx.refund();
```

#### Freezing and Unfreezing Cards

Freezing and unfreezing Gift Cards is similar to Account Cards.

```java
String cardId = "...";
GiftCard existingGiftCard = GiftCard.retrieveByCardId(cardId);
existingGiftCard.freeze();
//later:
existingGiftCard.unfreeze();
```

Note that freezing and unfreezing a card are special transactions and the corresponding `LightrailTransaction` object will be returned by these methods.
